<h1 class="title">UCRN is Persistent and is not Anonymous</h1>

<p>While writing my <a href="../02/popreg.pdf">response</a> to the <a href="http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2014/12/5990">Population Register consultation</a>, I
came across two bizarre assertions. The first is in the consultation
itself: 
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The UCRN is an anonymous number created by the NRS for each
individual on behalf of whom information is contained in the NHSCR.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
What on earth is this supposed to mean? The UCRN is
a <i>unique</i> <i>number</i> used to <i>refer</i> to a <i>citizen</i> contained in the
NHSCR database. Its purpose is to be a numeric <i>name</i> an individual.
In what sense is that anonymous?
</p>
<p>
It turns out that what they mean is explained in the next sentence:
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The number contains no personal or identifiable information.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
Ok, so the number itself isn't made from your birthdate or anything
like that. But this doesn't matter because <b>it</b> is identifial
information by definition.
</p>
<p>
There is nonsense of a similar kind in a related document, the 
<a href="http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Economy/digital/digitalservices/Sign-intoOnlineServices/myaccountPolicyPIA">Privacy Impact Assessment</a> for the "myaccount" service. This is
meant to be a single-sign-on service for interaction with any part of
the Scottish Government and uses the UCRN as the <i>primary key</i> to
match records from different databases. Supporting this service is
the main motivation for the information sharing that the consultation
is about.
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The UCRN&hellip; is not used as a Persistent Identifier. The UCRN will
only be used to match at a high level with a service provider's
records.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
Hopefully it's clear at least that the UCRN is in no way anonymous,
so it is an identifier. What does "persistent" mean? Persistent
information is information that sticks around. If you turn your
computer off and then on again, whatever you have saved to disk is
still there. It is persistent.
</p>
<p>
If this information is used to match against service provider's
records, the service provider needs to maintain a table of (internal
identifier, UCRN) pairs. It's hard to believe that this table is not
saved. The service would be useless if it were <i>not</i> saved. So it is
persistent. 
</p>
<p>
As far as I can tell, the authors of the consultation and the privacy
assessment are attempting to redefine the well known words
"anonymous" and "persistent" to mean their exact opposites.
</p>
<p>
Before moving on to the next bit of silliness, here is a truly
anonymous number for you:
</p>


<div id="anumber" style="width: 100%; text-align: center;"></div>
<script language="javascript">
  var randomnumber=Math.floor(Math.random()*10000000);
  document.getElementById("anumber").innerText = randomnumber;
</script>

<p>
The same privacy assessment also contains this statement:
</p>


<blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">
4. Measures taken against individuals as a result of collecting
   information about them might be seen as intrusive.
</p>
<p>
The only information held in myaccount will be given to the
individual for this purpose. The information does not include any
information about service use.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I have quite a lot of trouble believing this. The "myaccount" service
is meant to be a trusted authentication source. It receives requests
to authenticate users from various places. The history of these
requests paints a picture of the interaction of a user with various
services. Each time they log in, they leave a footprint that says
they accessed a particular service.
</p>
<p>
If this information is not stored that means there is no logging being
done &ndash; hardly good news for trustworthiness because this would make
it impossible to know anything about how the system is or isn't
functioning. The only way that this statement can plausibly be true is
if it is interpreted to mean that the logs are not held <i>in</i>
myaccount but are held elsewhere by the operator of the myaccount
service.
</p>
<p>
Given that the operator of the myaccount service will then have a
history of each individual's interaction with online government
services, it is natural to consider this as a kind of
surveillance. Surveillance means to watch from above and (usually) to
record. As the operator of myaccount must do if it purports to be
trustworthy.  This is a new service, so the surveillance method is
new. And yet the privacy assessment dismisses this out of hand,
</p>


<blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">
3. New surveillance methods may be an unjustified intrusion on
individuals' privacy.
</p>
<p>
Not applicable.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Hardly.
