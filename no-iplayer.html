    <h1>City of Edinburgh Council censors the BBC in schools</h1>
    <pre>
    We  can debate  another time  about the  wisdom and  efficacity of
    filtering the Internet in schools in general. It can be an emotive
    issue. For  the moment let us  assume that it makes  sense, we all
    want to protect our children after all.

    The photograph  below taken earlier  at my son's school  goes well
    beyond that. He goes to the Gaelic school in Edinburgh and the BBC
    iPlayer is one of the  few places on the Internet with substantial
    content appropriate  for schoolchildren. So in  the first instance
    it's disruptive to his schooling.

    But the problem  goes deeper. Here is the  slippery slope. Perhaps
    it is ok to filter nasty  or even just objectionable things on the
    Internet,  we have assumed  that this  is the  case. Here  we have
    somebody in  the local  government who has  taken the  decision to
    censor access to the Internet on a completely different basis: the
    form  it  takes.  Radio   and  Television,  audio  and  video  are
    forbidden. No  matter if the purpose is  legitimate or educational
    or not. It's the BBC fer chrissakes.

    It's  hardly  a question  of  scarce  resources,  or at  least  it
    shouldn't be. If  it is there is something very  wrong. This is in
    the centre  of a city with decent,  modern infrastructure. Someone
    has just decided that a whole class of content is not allowed.

    That  some  anonymous  civil  servant  can  take  these  decisions
    arbitrarily is a very big problem.

    But, it's all good. In fact it's a perfect opportunity to teach my
    son about using  things like Tor to evade  censorship. It's just a
    bit strange for  this to be necessary in  a "civilised" place like
    Edinburgh.
