Dear City of Edinburgh,

This  is  a Freedom  of  Information  request pertaining  to  Internet
blocking  in  council-run  schools.   Web  sites  and  other  internet
resources are routinely blocked for the purposes of shielding children
from  nasty stuff  on the  Internet --  pornography, instructions  for
making explosives, extremist materials and  so forth. This FoI request
is not  about those. Rather  it is about  things that are  blocked for
other reasons. One example is the BBC iPlayer [1] which clearly is not
in those categories.

Please provide  a list of sites  or other Internet resources  that are
routinely  blocked or  otherwise censored  in council-run  schools for
reasons  other than  safety,  and,  for each,  the  reason  why it  is
filtered.

Thank you,

Dear Mr Waites

Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 - Refusal Notice

Subject: Internet in schools

Thank you  for your  request for information  of 08/09/2014  where you
asked  for information  regarding internet  blocking in  schools. Your
request has been processed under the Freedom of Information (Scotland)
Act 2002. Unfortunately it is not possible to meet your request.

You asked  the following:  

    “This is a  Freedom of Information request  pertaining to Internet
    blocking  in council-run  schools.  Web sites  and other  internet
    resources  are routinely  blocked  for the  purposes of  shielding
    children  from  nasty  stuff   on  the  Internet  --  pornography,
    instructions  for making  explosives, extremist  materials and  so
    forth. This  FoI request is  not about  those. Rather it  is about
    things that are blocked for other  reasons. One example is the BBC
    iPlayer which clearly is not in those categories.

    Please provide  a list of  sites or other Internet  resources that
    are routinely blocked or otherwise censored in council-run schools
    for reasons other than safety, and, for each, the reason why it is
    filtered.”

We  would not  place information  in  the public  domain that  reveals
operational details  about our  internet filtering systems.  Under the
terms of  the legislation,  a request for  information can  be refused
where one or more exemptions listed  in the legislation apply. In this
instance,  the Council  is  claiming the  following  exemption to  the
information that you have requested:

Section 30(c) – Prejudice to effective conduct of public affairs

The Council  holds the  information requested  but considers  that the
information requested is exempt from disclosure under section 30(c) of
the  Act  due  to  the   fact  that  its  disclosure  would  prejudice
substantially the effective  conduct of public affairs of  the City of
Edinburgh  Council and  other  persons for  the  following reason:  By
providing  information  about the  way  we  use technology  and  apply
electronic filters  through our IT  systems into the public  domain we
would potentially be putting our IT framework at risk.

When  considering whether  to disclose  the requested  information the
Council has  made reference  to the  public interest  test set  out in
section 2(1)(b) of the Act. Whilst the Council recognises the need for
information to  be publicly available and  for the Council to  be open
and transparent  regarding the way  it controls access by  children to
websites, in the current circumstances  this public interest in favour
of disclosure  is outweighed by  the Council's requirement  to protect
the integrity  of our IT  security. The  public interest would  not be
served  by the  Council  being  subjected to  the  potential of  cyber
attacks   that  could   breach  our   security  and   damage  our   IT
infrastructure.

Please note that this letter constitutes a formal refusal notice under
section 16 of the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002.

To  promote transparency  and accountability,  please note  it is  the
Council’s policy  to publish  all request  details and  responses made
under the freedom of information legislation. This information will be
made available through the Council’s website and will not include your
personal details.  The disclosure  log is  available at  the following
link: http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/homepage/175/foi_disclosure_log

ear Ms. Brown,

Thank you for your note on the  1st of October. I fully understand why
the Council might consider that technical details of its IT operations
are not  suitable for public disclosure.  I am less interested  in the
detail and  more interested in  the policy  that informs it  so please
allow me to reformulate my request.

Broadly, what are the bases on which Internet resources may be blocked
from access  in schools?  More specifically  what categories  exist of
unacceptable content and what guidance is provided to council staff to
determine  if  some  particular  content   falls  into  one  of  these
categories or not?

Recognising that the Internet is not  the web -- there are many things
on  the Internet  that are  not  web sites  -- are  there any  blanket
prohibitions on protocols or broad classes of application that are not
permitted?  This question  should not  be considered  operational, but
rather what is acceptable in broad terms on the part of the users.

Thank you,

William Waites
