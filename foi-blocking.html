    <h1>FoI Request relating to Internet filters</h1>
<pre>
2014/09/06

Dear City of Edinburgh,

This  is  a Freedom  of  Information  request pertaining  to  Internet
blocking  in  council-run  schools.   Web  sites  and  other  internet
resources are routinely blocked for the purposes of shielding children
from  nasty stuff  on the  Internet --  pornography, instructions  for
making explosives, extremist materials and  so forth. This FoI request
is not  about those. Rather  it is about  things that are  blocked for
other reasons. One example is the BBC iPlayer [1] which clearly is not
in those categories.

Please provide  a list of sites  or other Internet resources  that are
routinely  blocked or  otherwise censored  in council-run  schools for
reasons  other than  safety,  and,  for each,  the  reason  why it  is
filtered.

Thank you,
